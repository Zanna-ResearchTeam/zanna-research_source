- 🧠 Postdoctoral Applications (review starts early Dec): we have multiple positions open as part of M²LInES, supported by Schmidt Futures and the NSF Science and Technology Center LEAP. For further details and applications, please consult for the links for the M²LInES [position](https://apply.interfolio.com/117150) and LEAP [position](https://apply.interfolio.com/117147).

- 💡 Graduate Students: I welcome applications from students with strong applied math or physics background interested in quantitative climate physics (using theory, numerics, data science). I am accepting PhD students through [CAOS](https://caos.cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/phd-program/overview/), [Applied Math](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/graduate/phd-mathematics/), and [CDS](https://cds.nyu.edu/phd-admissions-req/). Read carefully the application pages for details about the program, application, requirements, etc. Given the large volume of emails received, I might not respond to your enquiries until I see your application unless you have a specific question/concern not addressed in the admission page or below. In CAOS, you are admitted to the program, not an adviser or a research project. If a student is accepted in CAOS, they will be able to discuss research projects with potential advisors during their first year. If a student is interested in working with me, make sure you mentioned my name in your application and please browse through this website and my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xWZmhjsAAAAJ&hl=en) to get an idea of our research projects. Feel free to reach out to group members if you have any inquiries about our research. I welcome applications from students with strong applied math or physics background interest in quantitative climate physics (theory, numerics, data science).

- Undergraduates, Interns and K-12: We are not accepting any applicants for the foreseeable future.
